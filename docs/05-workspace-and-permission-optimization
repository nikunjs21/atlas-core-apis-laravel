5️⃣ POLICIES (Fine-grained Authorization)

Status: 🟡 PARTIALLY DONE (AND THAT’S OK)

You correctly understood the distinction:

Middleware → role/module level

Policy → object ownership level

At Day 3, it’s perfectly fine if:

You created policies but didn’t fully wire them everywhere

Or you documented intended usage

We’ll strengthen this on Day 4 with Tasks.

No penalty here.

6️⃣ WHAT IS SLIGHTLY MISSING (MINOR, NOT BLOCKING)

These are improvements, not failures.

🟡 1. Workspace resolution strategy

Right now, workspace is probably coming from:

route param

or request body

Later, we should standardize:

X-Workspace-Id header
or

{workspace} route binding

Not needed today — just noting for Day 4/5.

🟡 2. Permission caching (NOT NOW)

Eventually:

Cache permissions per role

Avoid DB hits per request

But do NOT implement this yet.
Just mention it in docs later.
